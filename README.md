# credit_card_fraud_detection_cs419

A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts so paid plus the other agreed charges.
The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognise fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. So, we are going to learn about fraud detection using the classification algorithm of supervised learning.
